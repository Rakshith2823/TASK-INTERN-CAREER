# TASK-INTERN-CAREER
This was an internship project consisting of two tasks related to data analysis, the details of the tasks are as below:

Task-1: YouTube Streamer Analysis
Data was provided on the top 1000 YouTubers' statistics such as ranking, categories, subscribers, country, visits, likes, comments and more.
I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to extract insights about the top YouTube content creators such as Data Exploration, Trend Analysis, Audience Study, Performance Metrics, Content Categories, Brands and Collaborations, Benchmarking and Content Recommendations.

Task-2: Dashboard (Terrorism)
The Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the date, location, attack type, weapons used, number of casualties, and responsible groups. This database had data from 1970 to 2017.
From the provided database I have prepared the data as required by data cleaning and correcting data types. A dashboard is been created consisting of multiple KPIs and Donut charts, this is an interactive dashboard consisting of a slicer, maps and drill-through options.
